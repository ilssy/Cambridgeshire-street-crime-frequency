# Street crime in Cambridgeshire from June 2017 to April 2018

I used the UK [Home Office](https://data.police.uk/data/) street crime data to investigate the patterns of different
crime recorded in Cambridgeshire over the 11 month period.
Additionally, I analysed the monthsâ€™ impact on how much crime is recorded and its distribution
(e.g. in some months we might expect more crime and more (or less) specific kind of crime).
